## Proposal

I formally nominate [@haoxins](https://github.com/haoxins) to become a maintainer of the NebulaGraph repository.
Through numerous bug fixes and feature enhancements (such as bug fixes, code refactoring, etc.), haoxins has significantly improved the stability and functionality of the Nebula Go client. His high-quality code contributions demonstrate a deep understanding of the project, covering the following key areas:
